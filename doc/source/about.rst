This package is build as a python replacement for the R ndl2 package. Some
ideas on how to build the API and how to efficiently run the Rescorla Wagner
iterative learning on large text corpora are inspired by the way the ndl2
package solves this problems. The ndl2 package will be published to github in
August 2017 and a reference will be placed here.
