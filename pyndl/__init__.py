Pyndl - Naive Discriminative Learning in Python
===============================================

*pyndl* implements Na√Øve Discriminative Learning (NDL) in Python. NDL is an
incremental learning algorithm grounded in the principles of discrimination
learning and motivated by animal and human learning research. Lately, NDL
has become a popular tool in language research to examine large corpora and
vocabularies, with 750,000 spoken word tokens and a vocabulary size of 52,402
word types. In contrast to previous implementations, *pyndl* allows for a
broader range of analysis, including non-English languages, adds further
learning rules and provides better maintainability while having the same
fast processing speed. As of today, it supports multiple research groups
in their work and led to several scientific publications.
